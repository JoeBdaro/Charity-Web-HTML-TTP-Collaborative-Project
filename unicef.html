		<p> For 70 years, across 190 countries and territories, UNICEF defends the rights of every child.  Despite remarkable challenges around the world, UNICEF staffers fight for the rights of every child seeking safe shelter, nutrition, protection from disaster and conflicts, and equality. UNICEF works with the United Nations other United Nations agencies to make sure that children are on the global agenda. UNICEF strikes a balance between thorough research and practical solutions for children. All children deserve to live happy and healthy lives. Make a 100% tax-deductible donation today to give the world’s most vulnerable children the nutrition, water, and medical supplies they desperately need. The current system is failing refugee and migrant children.  Millions of children are on the move across international borders – fleeing violence and conflict, disaster or poverty, in pursuit of a better life.  The global number of refugee and migrant children moving alone has reached a record high. At least 300,000 unaccompanied and separated children were recorded in some 80 countries in 2015–2016, up from 66,000 in 2010–2011.  States have a responsibility to uphold their rights and protect all children within their borders, without exception. A child is a child. It is now time to act.</p>
